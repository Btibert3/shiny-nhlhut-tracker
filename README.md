# About

This project is an idea to build a shiny app that does one thing well

Lookup an NHL HUT card, accurately, and allow the user to log the price to a
data store.

## UI/X Brainstorm

- Left Hand Nav to search for player by name, dynamic filter,
- Selected player from the search name is shown on RH with image from API
- for the selected player, log a range of price data
-- current bid / BNP, Start Price (Ignore Contract for the moment)
- Log the input to the datastore
- Refresh for a "clean", or blank, UI to find another player
